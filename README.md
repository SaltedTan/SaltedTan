I'm a 2nd year student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Research & Development) (Honours) at the Australian National University.

My interest lies in web development and I am currently learning to be a full stack engineer on Codecademy.

I also have a bit of interest in artificial intelligence as well as machine learning.
